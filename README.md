# SMA-Crossover Algorithmic Trading with Interactive 
By analyzing the moving averages of asset prices, we can determine entry and exit points for our trades. The goal is to buy when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average and sell when the opposite occurs.

# Algorithmic Trading with Interactive Brokers API

Welcome to the repository for algorithmic trading using the Interactive Brokers API! In this project, we explore the world of automated trading strategies using Python and Interactive Brokers API.
